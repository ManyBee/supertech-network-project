## 🎯 Objective
Design and implement a corporate network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**, focusing on **VLAN segmentation, subnetting, and IP addressing (static and dynamic).**

## 🛠️ Technologies
- Cisco Packet Tracer  
- Cisco Switch 2950-24T  
- VLANs (10 and 20)  
- DHCP and Static IP  

## 📌 Scope
- Creation of **4 subnets** (Engineering, Purchasing, Internal IT, Infrastructure)  
- VLAN configuration (10 and 20) on each switch  
- Static IP addressing for Engineering and Internal IT  
- DHCP configuration for Purchasing and Infrastructure  
- Connectivity testing (ping and DHCP validation)  

## 📊 Results
- Correct communication between devices in the same VLAN  
- Isolation between different VLANs  
- Automatic IP assignment via DHCP successfully implemented
